# Challenge 1 Horiseon project

## Description
- My motivation was to complete this project as part of the bootcamp and learn how to make more accessible webpages
- This assignment used existing code and refactored it to make the code more accessible to people with disabilities

Learning objectives
- Add alt attributes to icons and image to make it easier for those with impairments to access 
- Changing the structure of HTML elements to follow a more logical flow, independent of styling and positioning
- Changing the title element to make it descriptive but concise

## Installation
Clone the GitHub repository onto your computer using the command
git clone git@github.com:hutgib2/bootcamp-challenge-1-horiseon-accessibility.git

## Usage
This code can be used as an example of how to optimize a webpage for search engines and improve accessibility

## Credits
There were no collaborators on this project, however, tutorials and information from the USYD coding boot camp provided assistance.
